\description{
This dataset contains information on fishing landings of the white ray
using the traditional "grozeira" method in Todos-os-Santos Bay, Brazil.
The data were collected from January 2012 to January 2013, covering 186 fishing
operations. The objective of the study was to analyze the relationship
between the catch per unit effort (CPUE) and various environmental factors.
}
\details{
The dataset can be used to study the impact of environmental factors
on the catch efficiency of white ray fishing. It provides valuable information
for fisheries management and environmental studies.
