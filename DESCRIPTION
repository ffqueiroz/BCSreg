Description: A collection of tools for regression analysis of positive data,
    including zero-inflated data, based on the class of the Box-Cox symmetric (BCS)
    distributions. The BCS distributions are a class of flexible probability models
    capable of describing different levels of skewness and tail-heaviness. The package
    offers a compreensive regression modeling framework, including estimation and tools for
    evaluating goodness-of-fit.
