Description: A collection of tools for regression analysis of non-negative data,
    including strictly positive and zero-inflated observations, based on the class of the Box-Cox
    symmetric (BCS) distributions and its zero-adjusted extension. The BCS distributions are a 
    class of flexible probability models capable of describing different levels of skewness and 
    tail-heaviness. The package offers a compreensive regression modeling framework, including 
    estimation and tools for evaluating goodness-of-fit.
